# Time Engineers vs Task PMs: A Simple Story
_*names changed_

Last week, I learned something cool about how engineers and product managers think. It all started when I was having coffee with my friend Alex*, who's an engineer.

Alex was upset about his new product manager, Sarah*. He said, "She keeps giving us more work. It's like she doesn't care how long things take!"

That's when I realized: engineers and PMs think about work differently. Here's what I mean:

1. How Engineers Think:
   Engineers like Alex care a lot about time. They think about how many hours or days a job will take.

2. How PMs Think:
   PMs like Sarah focus on getting things done. They have a list of features they need to finish.

3. When These Ideas Clash:
   This can cause problems. Engineers feel like there's too much work, and PMs don't understand why their requests are hard.

So, what can we do? Talk to each other! I told Alex to explain to Sarah how engineers plan their work.

The next time I saw Alex, he was happy. He said, "Sarah and I talked. Now we're trying something new. We're breaking big tasks into smaller chunks with time limits. It's better for both of us."

This story shows that when we try to understand each other, we can solve problems. Maybe this idea could help your team too!

That's all for now. Time for me to start my next blog post!
